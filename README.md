# Fake News Detection

## Overview
This project is a machine learning-based fake news detection system. It utilizes Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and a machine learning model to classify news articles as either REAL or FAKE.

## Features
- Data preprocessing and text vectorization
- Model training using machine learning algorithms
- Evaluation of model performance
- Prediction of real or fake news

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- Jupyter Notebook


## Usage
1. Run the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```sh
   jupyter notebook
   ```
2. Open the notebook and follow the steps to train the model and classify news articles.

## Dataset
The dataset used contains labeled news articles as either REAL or FAKE. It is preprocessed before training the model.

## Model Training
The model is trained using:
- **TF-IDF Vectorization**: Converts text data into numerical format
- **Logistic Regression**: Used for classification of news articles

## Prediction
After training, the model can predict whether a given news article is REAL or FAKE based on its textual content.
